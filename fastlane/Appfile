# fastlane/Appfile

# Your Apple Developer Team ID (10 characters)
team_id(ENV["IOS_TEAM_ID"])  # set in CI as a secret/env var

# Optional but nice if you have it:
# apple_id("you@company.com")

# Optional: only needed if you want fastlane to know an identifier up front.
# With multiple variants, you can leave this out or set it to prod.
# app_identifier("com.beekeepr.app")
